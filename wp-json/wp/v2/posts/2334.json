It can be useful for cooking delicate foods that might otherwise stick to the pan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there\u2019s controversy around nonstick coatings, such as Teflon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some sources claim they\u2019re harmful and linked to health conditions such as cancer, while others insist that cooking with nonstick cookware is completely safe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article takes a detailed look at nonstick cookware, its health effects and whether or not it is safe to cook with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Is Nonstick Cookware?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nonstick cookware, such as frypans and saucepans, has been coated with a material called polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), commonly known as Teflon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Teflon is a synthetic chemical made up of carbon and fluorine atoms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was first made in the 1930s, and provides a nonreactive, nonstick and almost frictionless surface (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/004316489290039B\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">1<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The nonstick surface makes Teflon-coated cookware convenient to use and easy to clean. It also requires little oil or butter, making it a healthy way to cook and fry food.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Teflon has a number of other applications. It is also used to make wire and cable coatings, fabric and carpet protectors, and waterproof fabrics for outdoor clothing such as raincoats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, over the past decade, the safety of nonstick cookware has been under investigation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The concerns have centered on a chemical called perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), which was previously used to produce nonstick cookware, but isn\u2019t used today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The investigations have also looked into the risks associated with overheating Teflon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Summary: Nonstick cookware is coated with a material called polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), also known as Teflon.

It also lasts a long time and can withstand temperatures well above those considered safe for nonstick pots and pans.<\/li><li><strong>Stoneware:<\/strong>&nbsp;Stoneware has been used for thousands of years. It heats evenly and is nonstick when seasoned. It is also scratch-resistant and can be heated to very high temperatures.<\/li><li><strong>Ceramic cookware:<\/strong>&nbsp;Ceramic cookware is a relatively new product. It has excellent nonstick properties, but the coating can be easily scratched.<\/li><li><strong>Silicone cookware:<\/strong>&nbsp;Silicone is a synthetic rubber that is mainly used in bakeware and kitchen utensils. It does not stand up well to direct heat, so it\u2019s best suited for baking.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Summary: Most modern nonstick cookware is safe if you use it correctly.
